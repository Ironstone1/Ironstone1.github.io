A 1v1 map! Play with your friends or against bots.

commands:
type "bot_kick all" to kick the bots
type "mp_restartgame 1" to restart the game.


UPDATE:
After having thoroughly played 1v1_wood against several different players, both better and worse than me (from Global Elite to Silver), I have noticed a few things. The original map featured ramps on each side of the map which each player could spawn onto, when spawning here, it gave that player an advantage as it allowed them to head glitch.

In a perfect 1v1 map, no player should have an advantage, a players likelihood to win a round should be based off of how skilled they are with weapons, rather then where they spawn in the map. To address this issue, I have removed the ramps and instead put a wall up that the player spawns behind.

Another thing I noticed is that if you won the previous round, you have a greater chance of winning the next round, because the player that lost has to spend time buying a weapon, giving the enemy player a chance to hold an angle with an AWP for example and wait for them to peak. So to fix this players automatically get a weapon when they spawn so they dont have to buy one.

I have also given players (with the stock knife equipped) a butterfly knife as soon as they spawn, because who doesn't love a custom knife? xD

Anyway this is the map now after all of the improvements, I fixed all of the problems I could find, if there is any other problems you spot or changes you think I should make, please leave a comment on this workshop page.
