[f1,f2,f3,...]

dont clear the whole list, jsut delete a frame from the list after adding it to the video

get key by value

62, 91, 121, 151 - last frame gets stuck

frames still being assigned in wrong order


records 30 frames, adds them to the list
tries ot iterate through length of dict writing every frame
- instead what should happen is the write func is assigned a range of frames to write

write counter is only used in the naming of the file

most frames are in order now, a few at the end are not

to do:
- video compression
- export options, e.g. export as mp4
- record sound
- GUI with buttons

3-4 frames at the end of each second in wrong order
frames 0-30 not being written
