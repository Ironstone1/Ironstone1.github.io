notes:
pro player that i have missed out, either dont have config files, have not made there configs pubicly avaliable.
and pros that i have added but put a ? next, means there config files do not contain commands to adjust there crosshair.
or there crosshair is unknown, maybe they adjust it through the CSGO settings menu instead of using commands.
or they could be using the deafult crosshair.
