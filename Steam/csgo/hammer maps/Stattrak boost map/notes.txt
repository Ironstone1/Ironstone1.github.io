math_counter can be used to keep track of stattrak kills
- you can set the map to stop firing after hitting a specific number of kills
   - e.g. 99, 100, 999, 1000, 9999, 10k

1 kill per second:
60*60 = 3,600 kills per hour
100k/3.6k = 27.7 hours
1m/3.6 = 277 hours (11.5 days)

if map can do 1 kill per 0.5 second:
60*2*60 = 7,200 kills per hour
100k/7.2k = 13.8 hours
1m/7.2k = 138 hours (5.7 days)

if map can do 1 kill per 0.2 second:
60*5*60 = 18,000 kills per hour
100k/18k = 5.5 hours
1m/18k = 55 hours (2.3 days)

1 kill per 0.1 seconds:
60*10*60 = 36,000 kills per hour
