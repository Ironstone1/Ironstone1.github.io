hurt trigger that only effects bots



the player joins the game, and doesnt take control of a bot

seems to work:
- player alwasy joins the CT team

dodesnt work:
- if you kick the bot, the game just ends and displays the scoreboard
- if the enemy bot dies to a trigger_hurt the game ends
- if the bot dies to fall damage the game ends

ways to kill a player in hammer:
- +attack/-attack firing weapon			this works
- trigger_hurt					doesn't work
- fall damage					doesn't work
- drown the player				

quickest weapon to switch and fire to is the knife. 1 second
