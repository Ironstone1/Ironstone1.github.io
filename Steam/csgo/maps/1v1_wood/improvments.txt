Improvments 

- Remove clipping from railing by the stairs; they are greater than 45 degrees so you fall off them.
- Floor texture could be some dirt or grass.
- I think the ladders could be replaced with a prop, or at least made straight and same width.
- Add clips to the blocks on the bridge so you can run along it. Also make the skybox higher because you cannot jump when on the highest part of the bridge.
- May want to add a clip or remove the overhang on the ramp by spawn so people cant get stuck when crouching (optional).
- Dunno why u ended that tile texture, as it would look good on the whole top section.

Good stuff 

- Finally got rid of that stupid mat_fullbright 1.
- Better texturing.
- Finally added clipping.
