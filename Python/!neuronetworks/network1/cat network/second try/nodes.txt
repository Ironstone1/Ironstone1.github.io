cost function - add the output - excepted output sqaured
(network output - expected output)^2 + (... - ...)^2

gives you total cost of network
you want to decreate the cost so get it closer to 0

want the network to output a yes or no answer if it is a cat

--- i think ---
back propogation
itterate throhygh each layer for each layer

single layer back:
relu(data, weight)
np.dot(data, previous data)

you need to calculate cost for every weight and indivudall adjust

for i in layer:
	for weight in layer:
		figure out dicrection to move value using cost

log:
Li = -log(yi, k)
Euler's number e = 2.718281828459045

solving for x:
b = e ** x
