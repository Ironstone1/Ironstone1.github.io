# Task 1
numlist=[10,18,14,11,9] # creates varible 'numlist' that stores list of intigers
minimum=min(numlist) # creates varible 'minimum' and sets it's value to the lowest intigers in list
print("Minimum=",minimum) # outputs "Minimum=" as string and value of minimum varible as intiger
maximum=max(numlist) # creates varible 'maximum' and sets it's value to the highest intiger in list
print("Maximum=",maximum) # outputs "Maximum=" as string and value of maximum varible as intiger

# Task 2
scores=[["Hugh",23],["Pugh",45],["Barney",76],["MaGrue",42]] # creates list 'scores'
minimum=min(numlist) # sets varible to minimum value
print("Minimum=",minimum) # outputs "Minimum" string and varible content
