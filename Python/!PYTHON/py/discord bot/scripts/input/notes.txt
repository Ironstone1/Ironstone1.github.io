this is my thoughts on how it could be possible though:
if an input is present in the code
node takes the next messages after code is started executing, and writes each message to a text file (overwriting the previous message in the input.txt file)
the python input() function then reads the message from the text file

only if the files content has changed does the python input function then return the string of files content
- python can check if the files content has changed by generating an md5 hash of the files contents ever lets say 0.1 seconds
