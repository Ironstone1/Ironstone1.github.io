compress:
mp3 is decompressed back to original samples
only record the peaks and trofs of the waveform, throw away all the other samples
array of peaks/troffs then compressed into a string of characters that represents the original waveform

decompress:
string of characters is converted back to array of peaks/troffs
maths is used to guess what the rest of the waveform looks like
- draw vectors using the peak/troff information
resample the vector
compress the resampled vectors back into an mp3 file
