the trigger worked fine, the bot was losing health but the client was not.
if he bot dies via suicide aka trigger_hurt, then the match will end and display scoreboard.
- this means the bot has to die at the hands of the client.
- but the bots moves around making it hard ot kill the bot
  - maybe a grenade will be easier.


whats stopping the bot from also throwing a grenade

if the client dies, then the match will end
