If there is already a file with the same name in your maps folder, save a copy of it to your desktop or somewhere else safe so you have a backup. Then delete the file in your maps folder, and rename the win_5000_rounds.bsp file to the new map name as step 4 says.

Finally open the console in csgo and type 'map <name of map above>' to play the map you renamed, and get the win 100 rounds achievements for each of the other maps. for example to then get then for Aztec Map Veteran, type 'map de_aztec'.

once you finished getting the 100 rounds achievements, make sure to put back the original maps that you backed up, back in your maps folder.
