A map to help get the Rampage achievement, "Win an Arms Race match without dying".

How to use:
- Join the counter terrorist (CT) team
- then just wait, the map will get the kills for you it's automatic

This is an older version of my achievement rampage map, I'm uploading this one so anyone who preferred this version of the map to the new one, can play it.

Once you have got the achievement, open the CSGO console and type -forward;-back;-attack;-attack2 to stop the movement and attack commands from being executed.
