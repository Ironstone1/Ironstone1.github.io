			<p><h1><u>About Me:</u></h1></p>
			<div class="About-Summary">
				<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
				<p>I am an Early Years Professional with a passion for Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND). Working within a District Specialist Centre pathfinder&#44 I have been privy to the roll out of the Wiltshire Local Offer and been involved in the implementation of some of the first &#34My Plans&#34 which combines Education and Health to ensure a holistic approach and joined up services for each child or young person from 0-25 years through the introduction of SEND Lead Workers and the &#34Single Point of Contact&#34 service. My experience in writing Single-Page Profiles and Person-Centred Planning which is now at the heart of all early years practice&#44 has enabled me to understand the needs of settings and practitioners better so that I can write and deliver training workshops that are current and relevant. &#34Learning through play&#34 and &#34Partnership with Parents&#34 are two of the most important messages I like to leave with practitioners and parents&#44 as these underpin a child&#39s well-being and development. </p>
				<p>Skills Matrix & Personal Attributes Before finding my element in early years education, I was a Hotelier and Restaurateur. Working within this demanding, fast-paced industry taught me good business skills, time and project management abilities, endurance, resilience, managerial skills, diplomacy and it gave me insight into the impact of socio-economic and cultural differences. I have owned and managed my own restaurant and early years setting, which entailed all the managerial, financial and human resources responsibilities. I have carried these professional skills through to my employment and found them invaluable in working with colleagues, other practitioners and families when providing 1:1 support or facilitating training.</p>
