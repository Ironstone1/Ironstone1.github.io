Level Playing Field
Kill an enemy who is on gold knife level with a sub-machine gun in Arms Race Mode


client kill T until you got sub-machine gun (SMG)
teleport T to another room
T kill CT until golden knife
teleport T back to same room as client
kill T with your sub machine gun and  win round

2 CT, 1 T

player is on right side
bot is on left side

Arms Race 1,0

very first weapon you get is an SMG (MP7/9)

teleport bot to left

need CT bot to shoot the T bot once, so the bot becomes aware of the player
once the CT bot dies to the T bot, trigger needs to be present to teleport the CT bot back.
- dont use logic_auto

how to make a bot shoot?
give the bot a weapon for a second, then remove the weapon

neither of the bots have weapons now


reduce the time it takes to teleport the bot
increase the math_counter

oneway glass
Block LOS texture

CT spawns facing the wrong way
window showing skybox outside

if the bot doesnt die after 10 seconds, kill the bot, and reduce 1 from the math_counter
set bot health low
make bot more aggresive

barrier that is hidden when the bot spawns


sometimes it 15 weapons, other times it's 16.

test if the bot can knife another ct?
- no but then the bot would win the round

both the CT and T get teleported to another room after T has 30 kills.
the T cant knife the CT in this room
the T has 10 seconds to kill the CT:
  if the T does kill the CT, then great teleport the T to the client
  if the T does not kill the CT, then teleport the T to the client after 10 seconds


shotgun had to reload
also pistols dont fire enough to kill the player
- could sove this my setting the players health to 1

it worked for 16 weps
AWP scope

for 15 it didnt teleport the bot strait away

add a please wait sign
