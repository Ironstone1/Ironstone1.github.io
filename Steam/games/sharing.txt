- he cant login again even if he does figure out your password
  - such as with using a keylogger as you enter your credentials
  - as he would need the Steam Guard code

login to my steam on his computer
- enter username and password yourself, so he does not know it

authorise steam family sharing, on the computer
he then logins into his own account

what happens if he suddenly shutsdown the remote connection as soon as i login?
- you can use the Deauthorize all other devices button
https://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage

what happens if he loads a VAC secured like CSGO, or TF2 and cheats on it?
- then you would recive a VAC ban on your steam account
- how to avoud this?
  - so you, share your games with him
  - then he logins into his own account
  - then use SAM to unlock achiv in all of the games you shared with him
     - while you watch him, if he tries to shut down the connection or you can no longer see his screen
       - then immediately deauthorize all other devices:
       - https://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage

The Deauthorize all other devices, does not log you out of an already logged in account.

does changing your password log you out of the account of all devices?
