write2video function writes wrong fames becuase take_screenshot is running at the same time.

write previous frames

range(self.frame_counter-self.avg_fps, self.frame_counter)

is writing previous frame...

			expected
0-31, 0 = -31,0		(0,31)
31-31,31 = 0,31		(31,61)
61-31,61 = 31,61	(61,91)

writer thread could jsut continue to endlessly write frames without stopping every second

if new frame in dict, write frame to disk

How does writer know when the video ends?
- self.var ends while loop

video playing to fast, FPS not match with video


<<<<<<< HEAD
use threading to execute take_screenshot multiple times a second

tkinter GUI

video write cant write frames to disk fast enough
- resulting in the RAM getting used up, and then eventually causing a MemoryOverflow

you can record a second video, after recording a previous one within the same python isntance
- as the writer does not write it to the disk
