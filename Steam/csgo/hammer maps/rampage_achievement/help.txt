the map worked fine in hammer CSGO
the map didnt work, when loaded in normal game

the maps BSP files are identical in steam folder and hammer version.
- so the problem is with the current map, 
  not a out of date version of the map being uploaded to workshop as initially thought.

the problem haasnt been fixed

teleport the player

is arms race considered a round?
no, there are no rounds in arms race, just a match
